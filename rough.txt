How does containers achieve isolation between each other:

Namespaces: different types of namespaces are pid, net, ipc ,mnt, uts.

pid namespace useful for basic isolation. Each pid namespace has its own process numbering. Each pid namespace has its own PID 1 or init like process. 

Each net namespace can have its own network interface.similar to VM case

mnt namespace directories mount points. Similar to chroot

uts namespace deals with hostname.

namespaces are created by the clone system call.

Cgroups, Chroot, lxc, libcontainer, AUFS etc.

advantages

	fast deployment, ~seconds
	better performance
	less bulky images

disadvantages

	not as secure
	resources are not reserved
	hard concept to grasp

Docker makes containers easy. Kubernetes, rocket are competing container products. Docker seems more popular at the moment.

Has a hub for existing sharable images. easy to use.
